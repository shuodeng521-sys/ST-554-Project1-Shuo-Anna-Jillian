Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

1. The line # !pip install ucimlrepo should be actual code, not commented out.  
Since this is part of the setup, it’s better to show it as executable code so readers know it needs to be run the first time.

2. Consider adding a “Data Cleaning / Preparation” section header.  
You already did the cleaning steps, but giving them their own header would make the notebook structure clearer and easier to follow.

3. For the numeric summaries of True_C6H6, I recommend adding a bit more detail.  
Specifically:
A histogram to show the overall distribution shape of C6H6 (e.g., right‑skewed).
A boxplot of C6H6 by season, which helps visualize seasonal differences and supports the numeric summaries. This also highlights potential seasonal drivers of benzene concentration.

4. Overall, this is a thoughtful and well‑completed analysis.
